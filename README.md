Is all news real news? Can we trust all the news on social media and from various media outlets? How will we be able to detect fake news? The answer is with Python and Machine Learning!

## What is fake news?
Fake news includes pieves of news that may be false and is generally spread through social media and other onlien media sources. This technique is often used to impose certain ideas on the public and is ofte achieved with political agendas. These news itemas may contain both false and exaggerted claims which may end up being viralized by algorithms. Useres may also get caught in echo chambers of fake news on many common social media platforms. 

## What is a TfidfVectorizer?
- TF-IDF is an abbreviation for Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency
- This is an algorith to transform text into a meaningful representation of numbers which is used to fit machine learning algorithm for prediction 
- TF-IDF considers the overall documents of weight of words
- TF-IDF is a measure of origionality of a word by comparing the number of times a word appears in a doc with the number of docs the word appears in
  TF-IDF = TF(t,d)xIDF(t)
